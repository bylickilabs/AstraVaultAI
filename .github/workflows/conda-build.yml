# ============================================================
# 🧠 AstraVault AI – Conda Environment Build (Manual Bootstrap)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# ⚠️ THIS WORKFLOW IS CURRENTLY DISABLED
#
# Reason:
#   The official Mambaforge installer URL currently returns HTTP 404
#   errors, which break the CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions.
#
#   Once the installer link is stable again, simply remove the leading
#   '#' characters in this file (or rename it back to conda-build.yml)
#   to reactivate the workflow.
#
#   For now, use the pip-build.yml workflow, which runs without Conda.
