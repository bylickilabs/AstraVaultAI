[Vault Core] ── AES-256-GCM ──> [Data Layer: SQLite]
        │
        ├──► [AI Engine: File Classification & Scoring]
        │
        ├──► [Integrity Engine: Hash & Verification]
        │
        └──► [UI Layer: PySide6 Dark-Mode Interface]
```

> Each file undergoes Hashing → Classification → Encryption → Audit.  
  - Hash values are securely stored in the database before encryption.

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- GDPR compliant: fully local, no cloud dependencies  
- Zero-Knowledge password – cannot be recovered  
- Full activity audit trail maintained  
- Integrity protection via SHA & MD5 fingerprints  
- Recommended password length: ≥ 16 characters  
- All security-critical actions are logged

---

## ⚙️ Quick Start

```bash
python app.py
```

- Create a new vault & define your master password  
- Add files via Drag & Drop  
- AI automatically classifies sensitivity level  
- Vault auto-locks after inactivity  
- Export files securely when needed
